# Bombadil

Scripts I use for managing my OpenBSD home router, named bombadil.  Because
OpenBSD includes Perl in its base system, there's gonna be a bias toward Perl
here.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies, all of which are available through the OpenBSD
package manager, must be installed:

- Net::IP (p5-Net-IP)
